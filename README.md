  3. Run the shortcut on iOS.
  4. Select your playlist or choose "create new playlist."
  5. Paste your TXT content in the input field.
  6. Wait... This can take a while depending on the quantity of songs (approximately 2 seconds per song on average).
      --> You can monitor the progress in Apple Music by clicking on your playlist.
  7. Done! You will receive a notification when the playlist is finished.
      --> Review the report to see which songs were successfully transferred.
